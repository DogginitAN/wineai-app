Taylor Fladgate is an area leader in winemaking technology, as one of only three Porto producers to pioneer the development of piston fermenter techniques, called Port Toes, that extract significantly greater flavor and aroma than conventional pump-over fermentation. Fermentation is halted by the addition of grape spirits before all the residual sugar has been fermented, creating a sweet, fortified wine. Individual wines produced in different vintages are aged in 600-liter oak casks for years, over which time they will lose their young, dark purple-black color to gain the distinctive \u201ctawny\u201d hue from which the wine takes its name. As tawnies age, the wines take on increasingly more nutty flavors and become more concentrated as the barrels lose 3% of their volume every year (the \u201cAngels\u2019 Share\u201d) to evaporation. The 10 Year Old Tawny is a blend created using tawnies with an average of 10 years of aging.","brand":"Taylor Fladgate","source_url":"https://pascalesliquor.com/shop/product/taylor-fladgate-10-year-aged-tawny/null?option-id=dbd301e79c41f58c73249dab8a731ad2b3a9f4a573db24993806c0fee1fbc7a3","image_url":"https://cityhive-production-cdn.cityhive.net/products/69888f61bdadd6000161e342/large.png","subtype":"port","grape":"","colour":"Red","region":"","country":"","vector":[0.6,0.55,0.1,0.7,0.7,0.45,0.45],"confidence":"heuristic","match_type":"unmatched","rating":3.3,"rating_count":4},{"name":"Taylor Port","price":14.99,"description":"Taylor Port is a moderately sweet, ruby red wine with a rich, fruity taste.

The new generation of Zonins has already taken its place next to President Gianni Zonin, bringing with it a wave of youthful dynamism and also experience gained on other continents. The company's heart is located in Gambellara, in the province of Vicenza, an oasis of verdant hills and well-ordered vineyards. Gambellara is the ancestral home of the Zonin family. It has been famous for viticulture since the 1300s, as testifies by Pier de'Crescenzi in his Trattato d'Agricultura (treatise on Agriculture). This history that has manifested itself in the vicissitudes, the hard work and the inspired decisions of a family whose name is inextricably linked to passion for the land, its vines and wine. In the historic headquarters of the Company, the Zonins began to produce wines on a small scale in the early 1800s. In the next century, \"Commendatore\" Domenico Zonin would initiate an aggressive marketing strategy. This dynamic man, born in 1899, lived to the venerable age of 101, technically spanning three centuries. His youthful spirit bore witness to dramatic transformations of a way of life that evolved into modern present day in which a seventh generation of the family runs the firm. Today the Zonins honor their family's historical passion for the vineyard, the sine qua non for producing high-quality wines, by including \"Vintners since 1821\" on their logo.","brand":"Primo Amore","source_url":"https://myliquorexpress.com/shop/product/primo-amore-moscato/null?option-id=7e33d13161f2781693cb9811cef1c6dc3471bdfc0ae00295ac50a21c6499ecaf","image_url":"https://cityhive-production-cdn.cityhive.net/products/5ae294ba9746573da0c79fdb/large.png","subtype":"white","grape":"muscat","colour":"White","region":"Alsace","country":"France","vector":[0.03,0.55,0.55,0.45,0.9,0.13,0.3],"confidence":"high","match_type":"grape_colour","rating":4.1,"rating_count":11},{"name":"Sutter Home White Zinfandel","price":7.99,"description":"A refreshing White Zinfandel that delivers ripe notes of strawberries, melon, and raspberries.

Taylor Fladgate is an area leader in winemaking technology, as one of only three Porto producers to pioneer the development of piston fermenter techniques, called Port Toes, that extract significantly greater flavor and aroma than conventional pump-over fermentation. Fermentation is halted by the addition of grape spirits before all the residual sugar has been fermented, creating a sweet, fortified wine. Individual wines produced in different vintages are aged in 600-liter oak casks for years, over which time they will lose their young, dark purple-black color to gain the distinctive \u201ctawny\u201d hue from which the wine takes its name. As tawnies age, the wines take on increasingly more nutty flavors and become more concentrated as the barrels lose 3% of their volume every year (the \u201cAngels\u2019 Share\u201d) to evaporation. The 10 Year Old Tawny is a blend created using tawnies with an average of 10 years of aging.","brand":"Taylor Fladgate","source_url":"https://myliquorexpress.com/shop/product/taylor-fladgate-10-year-aged-tawny/null?option-id=dbd301e79c41f58c73249dab8a731ad2b3a9f4a573db24993806c0fee1fbc7a3","image_url":"https://cityhive-production-cdn.cityhive.net/products/69888f61bdadd6000161e342/large.png","subtype":"port","grape":"","colour":"Red","region":"","country":"","vector":[0.6,0.55,0.1,0.7,0.7,0.45,0.45],"confidence":"heuristic","match_type":"unmatched","rating":3.3,"rating_count":4},{"name":"14 Hands Hot to Trot Red","price":10.99,"description":"Red wine.

Maison Saint Aix is situated in the vineyards of a 140-year-old domaine. These vineyards are non-irrigated and on a plateau at 1,400 feet above sea level, one of the highest in the region. The Mistral wind keeps the grapes dry and healthy. The soil is clay and limestone, with some sandy plots that are rich in minerals. Maison Saint Aix is passionate about making the best Provence ros\u00e9, and as such their grapes are sustainably farmed.\n\nAIX Ros\u00e9 is produced in the typical Proven\u00e7al style using the direct pressing method. To avoid oxidation, the grapes are cold soaked and chilled to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. The grape clusters are then destemmed before pressing and are macerated at low temperatures for 5 to 6 hours. Each variety is fermented separately in temperature controlled stainless steel tanks at 57 degrees for 12 to 16 days, maintaining the aromas. To achieve the beautiful pale pink color Provence ros\u00e9s are known for, AIX uses cold stabilization. The wine is maintained on the lees in a closed tank with a neutral gas for one week at around 35 degrees. The lees give aromas and great body to the wine. The wine is then aged in a stainless steel tank for 2 to 3 weeks before bottling, resulting in a beautiful ros\u00e9 that is delicious year-round.","brand":"Aix","source_url":"https://shop.petersliquor.com/shop/product/aix-provence-rose/null?option-id=13799bf67ca95b96734712837d53c073fad095076fb27521e341bb0dcd664909","image_url":"https://cityhive-production-cdn.cityhive.net/products/69888e61f974ca00013f204d/large.png","subtype":"rose","grape":"","colour":"Rose","region":"provence","country":"France","vector":[0.05,0.65,0.15,0.21,0.8,0.05,0.2],"confidence":"heuristic","match_type":"unmatched","rating":3.7,"rating_count":20},{"name":"Aragosta Rosato","price":12.99,"description":"326 grower cooperative contributing to one winery in true Sardinian fashion.

Taylor Fladgate is an area leader in winemaking technology, as one of only three Porto producers to pioneer the development of piston fermenter techniques, called Port Toes, that extract significantly greater flavor and aroma than conventional pump-over fermentation. Fermentation is halted by the addition of grape spirits before all the residual sugar has been fermented, creating a sweet, fortified wine. Individual wines produced in different vintages are aged in 600-liter oak casks for years, over which time they will lose their young, dark purple-black color to gain the distinctive \u201ctawny\u201d hue from which the wine takes its name. As tawnies age, the wines take on increasingly more nutty flavors and become more concentrated as the barrels lose 3% of their volume every year (the \u201cAngels\u2019 Share\u201d) to evaporation.
